List of Android Concepts/Structures that you have decided to implement in your project
	• Google Maps
	• WebView
	• RecyclerView
	• Multiple Tabs
	• Fragments

• Were any of them more difficult/easy than you originally thought
	I thought it would be easy to get started with ReactJS or Flutter framework but later chose to stay with what I learnt in the class.

• What roadblocks did you hit along the way of developing the app?
	• Android studio was creating a new repo for the project when connecting to my github account. But I wanted to create a project inside the repo, so I don't have to create a repo for just one project. I then created the repository manually. Connected repo from Android Studio. Created a new project now. But I was unable to run the app. So I closed this project which has repository and the project under it. Instead opened the project folder only and then was able to run the app as well as it was Github connected. I then tried commit and push. Thus now found a way to create multiple projects under a single repo and not just a repo per project.
	• After creating the repo, I was not able to copy paste code from my old project into this new one, so I followed the steps once again. 
	• On adding WebView this time from my previous project, app started crashing. I had to debug and found WebView was coming up as null.
	• WebView was not accessible in the Fragment like it was in the Activity class, so tried couple of things and then found a way to access the findViewById function inside the Fragment. Had to override another API to fix the problem.
	• After crash was fixed, Webview was still not visible but was there in the design. I had to set background color, size changes, layout changes to make it work.
	• Unable to remove the space on top of the webview. Tried making changes in layout, main navigator, main activity, still not fixed.
	• Local Webpage was not loading properly so had to find a way on how to enable javascript on webview. First I tried showing a popup message to see if JS is working but popup did not show up, even after enabling JS. Then I tried using document.write and found javascript is enabled but popup is not working.
	• Enabling a click on the Map marker did not work initially but after reading how its click can be captured I was able to get hold of a view element and then display my toast using that view
	• RecylerView required, this time I used the default template and then customized it to my needs. I was not able to set the background color for entire panel 


• Were there any planned features that you had to cut/change?
	Yes following things I wanted to do but haven't been able to complete them all.
	• I wanted to store the locations data in a database using sqllite but have not been able to implement
	• Login and authentication with a remote service
	• Appointment service to store user data remotely
	

• Are there any parts of your app that aren't currently working/bugged?
	No  major issues but minor things like excessive whitespace 

• What did you do to try to fix it?
	I tried rearranging the controls. Used different layout. Reached out for help.

• Do you think more time could have helped you fix it?
	Yes, I think I can work on it, but there were other bigger features which focused on and couldn't spend enough time on it.

• If you were to build this app again, what would you do differently?
	I want to build it using the framework. The html content in the app will be a remote web content or using a framework. Many of its part I will create native UI.

• Would you have changed the scope of your project?
	Yes, I think I tried to do a full app as in a job one will have to create. It increased my scope for this project.

• And Finally, if you had the chance to give yourself advice from before the Planning Proposal assignment, what relevant advice would you give yourself?
	Clearly list the scope and follow, more is less and less is more. 
	Experiment on copy of code as trying on the primary project made me work on some in progress work problems which I could have discarded but since all work was done on the main copy, I could not proceed without fixing the problems created by hit and trial code. So next time I will do more experiments on copy code or use commit/rollback.
	I will start checkin for my code from the start.
	I will make progress on regular basis.
