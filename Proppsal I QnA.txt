• What were you able to accomplish this week?
	• Starting thinking about the project, trying web application based approach right now, attaching an image of the progress.
	• I have decided to make a mobile app for a Salon called SkySalon
	• I had created a javascript website for it during my earlier course. I wanted to reuse the work done. But my biggest challenge was to see if this idea works. Find how to embed website inside a mobile app.
	• So this time I experimented on it and was able to do a proof of concept.
• Did you face any type of challenges?
	• I had to learn how to create a web application in the mobile which is something new I am learning
	• I learnt how to use the webview control
	• Content was not loading then found I have to add permission in the manifest file. Once that was done it started working.
	• I had to fix the layout challenges which I was able to quickly resolve as it is just a prototype.
• Was something easier to implement than you thought?
	Not really, it is challenging for me, I am possibly going to change my approach and make it a native app so I can use more of my learnings
• How much time were you able to put into this project and how much more do you think is needed to finish it?
	It is a start, so little slow, but planning to ramp up more and more time.
• Is something stopping your progress?
	Not really
• What have you done so far to combat it?
	Discussing with friends to take their suggestions and thinking about the customer use cases
• Can you work around this issue?
	Yes
• Have you asked for help?
	Yes
• A screenshot of your app (required)
	Provided
• If possible, screenshots showing your progress is a great way to update your progress
• If not possible, please give a good reason why 
attached
• Submission of your entire project at this time
	I have discarded this proof of concept project and migrated code to another project on Github for which I have shared code in the next progress report. If you would like I can share this temporary project but since all good code is moved to new project skipped it for now.
• Not required, but may be a good way to show what you have done
• Also may be good if you need my help on something not working quite right
